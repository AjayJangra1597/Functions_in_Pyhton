    "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "    Generators are a type of iterable in Python, but unlike regular functions that return a single value and         terminate, generators produce a sequence of values lazily, meaning they generate values one at a time as         they are needed, rather than computing all of them at once and storing them in memory. This makes generators     very memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets.    "

    "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
    "Ans. \n",
    "    A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. Lambda functions are typically used for short, throwaway functions that are needed temporarily and are not intended to be reused elsewhere. They provide a concise way to write simple functions inline without formally defining them using the def keyword.\n",
